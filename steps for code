Create separate queues for students and faculty.
Add each incoming request to its respective queue.
Divide the two-hour window into equal time slots.
Work through each queue in a round-robin fashion, dedicating a fixed amount of time to each request before moving on to the next.
Keep track of the total time spent on handling queries and the total number of queries handled.
At the end of the session, calculate the average query time by dividing the total time spent on handling queries by the total number of queries handled.
